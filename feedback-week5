All three options are great! Any of those would work in my opinion for the project. I would say go with the option where the data is more available for you to scrape or download. I think option 2 might be a bit more difficult to scrape based on the availability of the data being so new so I would put that one towards the end of the list of choosing. I would say Option 3 may be the best because it provides access to the most data available but I maybe option 1 does that as well. I would go with either Option 1 or Option 3 purely from a data perspective. However, option 2 is doable but might cause a bit more work to do analysis on this data.  

Let me know if you need anything else.
